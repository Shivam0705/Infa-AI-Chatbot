#Infa-AI-Chatbot Deployment with Flask and NLP

Any new User when once tried to access Customer 360 application might have a lot of Questions on the App and features that are available and what are the useful things here like.

1. Why this app ?
2. What's here ?
3. What I get from here ?
4. We have it all covered by our Helpful Chatbot for MDM SaaS Customer 360 app.


#The Solution

In order to provide customer E2E guide with an aim to allow user to explore all possible features in BUI Apps (C360/S360/P360/MDE)
There is a need of an interactive chatbot which will guide the customers on how they can make use of all features, resolved some common frequently asked questions related to the product
This helps them  not to refer the documentation again and again and can continue their respective work just by interacting with the chat bot.
This will streamline the gap between customers and features available and reduces the overhead time and increases productivity.
