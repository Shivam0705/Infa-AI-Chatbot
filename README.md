#The Solution

In order to provide customer E2E guide with an aim to allow user to explore all possible features in BUI Apps (C360/S360/P360/MDE)
There is a need of an interactive chatbot which will guide the customers on how they can make use of all features, resolved some common frequently asked questions related to the product 
This helps them  not to refer the documentation again and again and can continue their respective work just by interacting with the chat bot.
This will streamline the gap between customers and features available and reduces the overhead time and increases productivity.
